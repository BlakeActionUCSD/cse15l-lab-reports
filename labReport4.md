Step 4:

I used the remote ssh extension in VSC to connect to the host server with a key.

After selecting "Connect to Host", I clicked "ieng6.ucsd.edu" from the drop down menu.

```<left_click>```

From here, I was able to choose a directory to open with VSC's file explorer. I clicked "Open Folder", then "OK" to get into my directory.

Step 5:

Once in the directory, I opened an integrated terminal, typed out "git clone git@github.com:BlakeActionUCSD/lab7.git" and ran the command.
The ssh key was copied directly from my Github repository.

Step 6:

First, I created a new itegrated terminal for the lab7 directory.

```<right_click><left_click>```

I copied the Mac junit files from a separate text file and pasted them into the terminal. At the end of junit run command, I added the class "TestListExamples".

```<ctrl + C><ctrl + V><enter>, <ctrl + C><ctrl + V> TestListExamples <enter>```

Step 7:

I changed went the ListExamples.java file via the explorer and changed index1 in the final while loop to index2, then saved the file.
