A few times throughout the quarter, I revisited the grading script from lab 6 in order to improve it and make it more functional.
The end result is simple, but it delivers an error report to the student, to help them diagnose their submission. If they are successful
in debugging their program, the grader will give them a diploma for their hard work.

The code I used for grade.sh includes junit and -f commands to test the submission once it has been received.
